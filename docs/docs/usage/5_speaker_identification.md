When transcript of some audio or video file is generated you can identify speakers in the transcript. Double-click the transcript in the list of transcripts to see additional options for editing and exporting.

Transcription view screen has option to identify speakers. Click on the "Identify speakers" button so see available options.  

If audio file is still present on the system speaker identification will mark each speakers sentences with appropriate label. You can preview 10 seconds of some random sentence of the identified speaker and rename the automatically identified label to speakers real name. If "Merge speaker sentences" checkbox is selected when you save the speaker labels, all consecutive sentences of the same speaker will be merged into one segment. Speaker identification is available since version 1.4.0 on all platforms except Intel macOS.
