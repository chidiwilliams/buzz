> **Note:** Transcribing audio using the default Whisper model is resource-intensive. Consider using the Whisper.cpp
> Tiny model to get real-time performance.

"Very Low" uses the "tiny" model; "Low" uses the "base" model; "Medium" uses the "small" model; and "High" uses the "medium" model. The larger models produce higher-quality transcriptions, but require more system resources. See [Whisper's documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) for more information about the models. |

### Record audio playing from computer (macOS)

To record audio playing from an application on your computer, you may install an audio loopback driver (a program that
lets you create virtual audio devices). The rest of this guide will
use [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) on Mac, but you can use other alternatives for your
operating system (
see [LoopBeAudio](https://nerds.de/en/loopbeaudio.html), [LoopBack](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/),
and [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/)).

1. Install [BlackHole via Homebrew](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole#option-2-install-via-homebrew)

   ```shell
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   ```

2. Open Audio MIDI Setup from Spotlight or from `/Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup.app`.

   ![Open Audio MIDI Setup from Spotlight](https://existential.audio/howto/img/spotlight.png)

3. Click the '+' icon at the lower left corner and select 'Create Multi-Output Device'.

   ![Create multi-output device](https://existential.audio/howto/img/createmulti-output.png)

4. Add your default speaker and BlackHole to the multi-output device.

   ![Screenshot of multi-output device](https://existential.audio/howto/img/multi-output.png)

5. Select this multi-output device as your speaker (application or system-wide) to play audio into BlackHole.

6. Open Buzz, select BlackHole as your microphone, and record as before to see transcriptions from the audio playing
   through BlackHole.
