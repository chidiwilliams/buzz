1. **Where are the models stored?**

   The Whisper models are stored in `~/.cache/whisper`. The Whisper.cpp models are stored in `~/Library/Caches/Buzz`
   (Mac OS), `~/.cache/Buzz` (Unix), or `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Buzz\Buzz\Cache` (Windows). The Hugging Face
   models are stored in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`.

2. **What can I try if the transcription runs too slowly?**

   Try using a lower Whisper model size or using a Whisper.cpp model.
