| Language   | See [Whisper's documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) for the full list of supported languages | "Detect Language"           | "Detect Language" will try to detect the spoken language in the audio based on the first few seconds. However, selecting a language is recommended (if known) as it will improve transcription quality in many cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

"Very Low" uses the "tiny" model; "Low" uses the "base" model; "Medium" uses the "small" model; and "High" uses the "medium" model. The larger models produce higher-quality transcriptions, but require more system resources. See [Whisper's documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) for more information about the models. |

### Record audio playing from computer

To record audio playing from an application on your computer, you may install an audio loopback driver (a program that
lets you create virtual audio devices). The rest of this guide will
use [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) on Mac, but you can use other alternatives for your
operating system (
see [LoopBeAudio](https://nerds.de/en/loopbeaudio.html), [LoopBack](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/),
and [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/)).

1. Install [BlackHole via Homebrew](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole#option-2-install-via-homebrew)

   ```shell
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   ```

2. Open Audio MIDI Setup from Spotlight or from `/Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup.app`.

   ![Open Audio MIDI Setup from Spotlight](https://existential.audio/howto/img/spotlight.png)

3. Click the '+' icon at the lower left corner and select 'Create Multi-Output Device'.

   ![Create multi-output device](https://existential.audio/howto/img/createmulti-output.png)

4. Add your default speaker and BlackHole to the multi-output device.

   ![Screenshot of multi-output device](https://existential.audio/howto/img/multi-output.png)

5. Select this multi-output device as your speaker (application or system-wide) to play audio into BlackHole.

6. Open Buzz, select BlackHole as your microphone, and record as before to see transcriptions from the audio playing
   through BlackHole.

## File import

To import a file:

- Click Import Media File on the File menu (or the '+' icon on the toolbar, or **Command/Ctrl + O**).
- Choose an audio or video file.
- Select a task, language, and the model settings.
- Click Run.
- When the transcription status shows 'Completed', double-click on the row (or select the row and click the 'â¤¢' icon) to
  open the transcription.

| Field              | Options             | Default | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Export As          | "TXT", "SRT", "VTT" | "TXT"   | Export file format                                                                                                                                       |
| Word-Level Timings | Off / On            | Off     | If checked, the transcription will generate a separate subtitle line for each word in the audio. Enabled only when "Export As" is set to "SRT" or "VTT". |

(See the [Live Recording section](#live-recording) for more information about the task, language, and quality settings.)

## Build

To build/run Buzz locally from source, first install the requirements:

1. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)

Then:

1. Clone the repository

   ```shell
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies.

   ```shell
   poetry install
   ```

3. (Optional) To use Whisper.cpp inference, run:

   ```shell
   make buzz/whisper_cpp.py
   ```

4. (Optional) To compile the translations, run:

   ```shell
   make translation_mo
   ```

5. Finally, run the app with:

   ```shell
   poetry run python main.py
   ```

   Or build with:

   ```shell
   poetry run pyinstaller --noconfirm Buzz.spec
   ```

## FAQ

1. **Where are the models stored?**

   The Whisper models are stored in `~/.cache/whisper`. The Whisper.cpp models are stored in `~/Library/Caches/Buzz` (
   Mac OS), `~/.cache/Buzz` (Unix), or `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Buzz\Buzz\Cache` (Windows). The Hugging Face
   models are stored in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`.

2. **What can I try if the transcription runs too slowly?**

   Try using a lower Whisper model size or using a Whisper.cpp model.
